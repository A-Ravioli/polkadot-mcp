## Presentation Tips

1. **Keep it visual**: Use diagrams, screenshots, and icons instead of text-heavy slides
2. **Consistent styling**: Maintain the same fonts, colors, and design elements across all slides
3. **Practice timing**: Aim for a 5-7 minute presentation (about 30 seconds per slide)
4. **Tell a story**: Structure the presentation as a narrative from problem to solution
5. **Show, don't tell**: Emphasize demonstrations and visual examples over explanations
6. **Highlight Polkadot**: Make sure to emphasize how Polkadot's unique features enable your solution
7. **Prepare for questions**: Anticipate technical questions about the implementation

## Canva Tips

- Use Canva's presentation templates as a starting point
- Leverage their icon library for blockchain and AI-related graphics
- Use the Smart Mockups feature to place your screenshots in device frames
